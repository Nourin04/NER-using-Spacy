## 🔍 About spaCy and displaCy

### 🧠 spaCy
[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is a powerful and fast open-source library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. It's designed specifically for production use and supports tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**. SpaCy comes with several pre-trained models for different languages, making it easy to extract meaningful insights from raw text.

### 🎨 displaCy
[displaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/visualizers) is spaCy's built-in visualizer for syntactic dependencies and named entities. It renders text with highlighted entities in a visually appealing way using HTML and CSS, making it ideal for web apps and educational tools.
